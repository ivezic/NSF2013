\heading {\bf Synergistic Activities}

\listing
{\bf Open Source Contributions:} I have developed fast sparse matrix eigen-decomposition code and graphical analysis for the numerical package {\tt scipy}, and a number of optimized supervised and unsupervised learning and data visualization methods for the machine learning packages {\tt scikit-learn} and {\tt MDP-toolkit}. I created {\tt SciDB-py}, a Python interface to SciDB.  I have also written and contributed to astronomy-speciﬁc packages such as {\tt astroML} (Astronomy Machine Learning), and {\tt SNANA} (Fermilab's supernova analysis software).

\listing
{\bf Digital Planetarium:} From 2010-2011, I managed and coordinated the upgrade of the UW planetarium to a digital system based on the World Wide Telescope software. This was a joint project between the University of Washington and Microsoft Research. I have developed related educational tools for K-12 class visits as well as undergraduate astronomy courses. I have occasionally partnered with Microsoft as an astronomy expert at a variety of education and technology conferences around the country.

\listing
{\bf Science Communication Fellow:} I have participated in the Portal to the Public training program at the Paciﬁc Science Center, and have volunteered regularly since 2009 as a Science Communication Fellow, exploring astronomical research with visitors to the museum.

\listing
{\bf Undergraduate Mentoring:} I have participated as a mentor for the U. Washington PreMajor in Astronomy Program (PreMAP), providing research experiences for under-graduates from demographics which are traditionally under-represented in the sciences.

\listing
{\bf K-12 Curriculum Development:} I taught for two years at the Mount Hermon Outdoor Science School, where among other activities I developed an outdoor astronomy curriculum for K-12 students, and conducted an astronomy training workshop for my peers at a regional conference for outdoor educators.
