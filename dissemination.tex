\subsection{Workshop} 
\label{sec:workshop}

At the last meeting, we assumed a 3-day workshop for about 30 faculty
from other institutions of higher learning who would want to emulate
our program. Further assuming \$20/ day/person for lunch and coffee,
and \$75/person for conference dinner, \$1,500 for the wor kshop
venue, and four grants of \$500 to young faculty and postdocs, we need
about \$7,500 fo r the workshop.
