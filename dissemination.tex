\section{Dissemination and Outreach}
\label{sec:outreach}


It is our strong desire to make our educational and research
program portable and adaptable by other institutions. For example, 
the lack of such a program that can be easily emulated was identified 
as one of the main impediments for wide adoption of astrostatistics
in graduate astronomy curricula around the country (by the Working 
Group on Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics of the American Astronomical
Society, chaired by the Co-PI Ivezi\'{c}).  We intend to make all our
materials public, including lectures for
both courses, data sets used in lectures and research seminars, and
all the data analysis code. 


\subsection{Workshop} 
\label{sec:workshop}

At the last meeting, we assumed a 3-day workshop for about 30 faculty
from other institutions of higher learning who would want to emulate
our program. Further assuming \$20/ day/person for lunch and coffee,
and \$75/person for conference dinner, \$1,500 for the wor kshop
venue, and four grants of \$500 to young faculty and postdocs, we need
about \$7,500 fo r the workshop.
