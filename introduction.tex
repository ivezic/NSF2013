\section{ INTRODUCTION}

This three-year project is an enthusiastic response to the EXTREEMS-QED (Expeditions in Training, Research, 
and Education for Mathematics and Statistics Through Quantitative Explorations of Data) solicitation for proposals
that aim to train the next generation of statistics and mathematics undergraduate students for confronting new
challenges in computational and data-enabled science and engineering (\cdse).  The proposed work addresses and 
includes all the main required project components: Education and Training, Research, and Faculty Professional 
Development. The proposed program will provide opportunities for undergraduate research and hands-on experiences 
centered on \cdse\ and will result in significant changes to the undergraduate mathematics and statistics curriculum 
at the University of Washington. We have secured broad institutional support and buy-in from two major departments 
(Statistics and Astronomy), and the proposed work includes a workshop centered on professional development activities
for faculty from other institutions wishing to emulate the proposed program.

In the remainder of this proposal, we describe each component in
detail, how they fit within the ACMS program and the overall ``Big
Data'' efforts within the University of Washington, and the budget and
execution schedule for the proposed program.
