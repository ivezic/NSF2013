\section{ INTRODUCTION}

This three-year project is an enthusiastic response to the EXTREEMS-QED (Expeditions in Training, Research, 
and Education for Mathematics and Statistics Through Quantitative Explorations of Data) solicitation for proposals
that aim to train the next generation of statistics and mathematics undergraduate students for confronting new
challenges in computational and data-enabled science and engineering (\cdse).  The proposed work addresses and 
includes all the main required project components: Education and Training, Research, and Faculty Professional 
Development. The proposed program will provide opportunities for undergraduate research and hands-on experiences 
centered on \cdse and will result in significant changes to the undergraduate mathematics and statistics curriculum 
at the University of Washington. We have secured broad institutional support and buy-in from two major departments 
(Statistics and Astronomy), and the proposed work includes a workshop centered on professional development activities
for faculty from other institutions wishing to emulate the proposed program.

This component will be centered around the Applied and Computational Math Sciences (ACMS) 
Program at the University of Washington. We will significanly enhance this program in the context of computational 
and data-enabled science and engineering by including two new specialized courses in the ACMS statistics track. 
The first course, STAT 391 ``Computational Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning'', will include essential statistical 
methodology, such as regression and probability models for discrete and continous data, as well as topics crucial for 
data-enabled science, such as classification and clustering. The second course, ASTR 497 ``Data Intensive Astronomy 
and Astrophysics'', will apply methods introduced in STAT 391 to contemporary massive datasets collected by modern 
astronomical sky surveys, and further expend them with domain-specific methodologies. These courses are designed 
(1) to give students a hands-on experience with statistical modeling through programming and performing real data 
analyses on a computer, and (2) to introduce students to the machine learning methodology in particular, with specific 
attention to the issues of big data, with astronomy as an attractive core science example. 

The Research component will build upon existing close collaboration between Statistics and Astronomy departments at the 
University of Washington, led by the PIs of this proposal. In addition to three faculty and an NSF postdoctoral Fellow, 
the proposed program will also include two graduate students and a large number of undergraduate students. We will 
utilize a suite of statistical and machine learning methods to attack a number of unsolved challenges in data-intensive 
astronomy posed by recent data avalanches coming from modern astronomical sky surveys. 

The proposed program, including course work and supporting research efforts, will represent a paradigm-shifting model  
that may be easily adapted by other institutions. To facilitiate such adoption, the Faculty Professional Development component 
will utilize several communication and dissemination techniques, culminating with a workshop for faculty from other 
institutions wishing to emulate the proposed program. The workshop, and a supporting website, will disseminate all the 
teaching materials (including datasets and code to perform hands-on research exercises) and the results of program 
effectiveness evaluation. 

In the remainder of this proposal, we describe each component in
detail, how they fit within the ACMS program and the overall ``Big
Data'' efforts within the University of Washington, and the budget and
execution schedule for the proposed program.
