\subsection{                      Key Project Aims                   }
 
This project will  {\bf i)}  develop something, {\bf ii)} 
apply these methods, and {\bf iii)}  synthesize and compare...

These deliverables will have an impact on the community that is much broader 
than the focus of this proposal. 


\subsection{Responsibilities and Schedule}

The PI, Meila, will be responsible for the overall success of the project.


The co-PIs, Connolly, Ivezi\'{c}, and Vanderplas will be grossly irresponsible. 


{\bf In summary, the project schedule is:}

{\bf Year 1:}
Think

{\bf Year 2:}
Do

{\bf Year 3:}
Analyze


\subsection{             Results from Prior NSF Support             }
\label{sec:priorNSF}

The Co-PI Ivezi\'{c} was recently PI on four projects supported by NSF that
are indirectly related to the work proposed here (mostly through data mining
aspects, public release practice for all data products, and through engaging large 
numbers of students in research and publication process). 

The projects ``Towards a Panoramic 7-D Map of the Milky Way'' (AST-070790) and 
``Mapping the Milky Way: Data-miners, Modelers, Observers, Unite!'' (AST-1008784)
quantified statistical behavior of a few tens of millions of Milky Way stars observed by 
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in multi-dimensional position--velocity--chemical composition 
space. The results were published in over a dozen refereed papers, and the work engaged
four graduate students (including two Ph.D. theses) and 11 undergraduate students.
A team of three undergraduate students has developed an education and public outreach site.

The key project aims for the NSF award AST-0507529 ``Interpretation of Modern Radio 
Surveys: Test of the Unification Paradigm'' were unification of several modern radio 
catalogs into a single public database containing several million sources and 
morphological classification of the matched sources. This three-year long project has 
produced six journal publications, two Ph.D. theses, and has engaged six undergraduate 
students in data analysis and publications. 

The project ``Statistical Description and Modeling of the Variability of Optical Continuum 
Emission from Quasars'' (AST-0807500) used time-domain data for the exploration of quasar 
physics. This three-year project has produced four journal publications, a Ph.D. thesis, and has 
engaged four undergraduates in data analysis and publications. 


\mmp{Zeljko's ``key words'' to scatter in the text moved here from the Introduction}
{\it 
1) course/class work 

- we will contribute to education of the next generation of mathematics and statistics 
   undergraduate students to confront new challenges in computational and data-enabled 
   science and engineering (\cdse) 

- we will also include math and stat minors 

- our efforts will result in significant changes to the undergraduate curriculum

- student training will incorporate computational tools for analysis of large data sets and
   for modeling and simulation of complex systems

- we will incorporating \cdse content in existing courses and develop new courses in 
   \cdse areas

- we will create resources for scientific education, including cyber-enabled pedagogies 
   (eBooks, online resources, etc.).

- we will foster interdisciplinary collaborations aiming to transform both departmental and 
   institutional culture.

- we have broad institutional support and department-wide commitment that encourage 
   collaborations within and across disciplines


2) research work

- research work will be broadly defined, long-term, team-based, interdisciplinary, and 
   will include with other institutions 

- we will development tools and theory for analyzing massive data sets

- we will use cyberinfrastructure to model and visualize complex scientific and engineering 
   concepts;

- we will create resources for scientific investigation, including state-of-the-art tools and 
  theory for knowledge discovery from massive, complex, and dynamic data sets

- we will foster interdisciplinary collaborations

- we will promote undergraduate research and hands-on experiences centered on \cdse

- the hands-on research work will developing CI competences (programming, data 
   management, simulation-building)

- we will leverage and advance the use of cyberinfrastructure resources (e.g. data archives, 
   networks, advanced computing systems, visualization environmnets) for data exploration

- we will address data-intensive scientific problems (arising in astronomy and ...)

3) workshop

- professional development activities centered on \cdse for faculty or K-12 teachers

- we will foster interdisciplinary collaborations

- we will create new learning environments and experiences that immerse students in \cdse 
   while energizing and sustaining the professional growth of faculty in \cdse
