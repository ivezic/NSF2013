{\bf About the ACMS program}

The ACMS {\em (Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences)} was
introduced in \mmp{fill} as a joint undergraduate program between the
departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering,
Mathematics and Statistics, among others.

The ACMS program is structured into a {\em core}, totaling 43 credits,
and a set of options, or {\em tracks}. The same set of core courses is
required for all options (with some exceptions). Options are either
associated with a particular application domain (Biological and Life
Sciences, Mathematical Economics, Social and Behavioral Sciences,
Engineering and Physical Sciences) or with a particular area of
specialization in the mathematical sciences ({\em Discrete Math and
  Algorithms, Operations Research, Scientific Computing and Numerical
  Analysis, and Statistics}). 

During the recent academic year, the enrollment in ACMS has been at
about 200 (what? student/year?), divided as follows: 


It is the Statistics track of ACMS that we are aiming to tranform. Currently, this track contains, in addition to the core courses (43 credits), the followin

The program web page recommends that ``[this track] is ideally suited as a second major for students with a primary focus in the biological sciences, earth sciences, social sciences, engineering, or management science.''

De facto, the track curricullum differs little, most notably by the
presence of the computer programming class CSE 142, from the
``standard'' Statistics major. Another notable difference from the
statistics major is STAT 390, a class for non-majors. 

To note also that the enrollment in the ACMS Statistics track was
\mmp{fill} in the last years, while the enrollment in the Statistics
major is at an all times high, with \mmp{fill}.

We will transform this track into a Computationally Minded Statistics
Major. In other words, we do not aim to produce scientists who also
know statistics (which can be well served by the other tracks of ACMS)
but full-fledged statisticians who can function autonomously in the
cyberworld.

 There are several motivating factors:
\bit
\item Interest in statistics is at an all times high, as witnessed by our enrollment numbers. We expect that the ACMS Statistics track will be as well.
\item The role of the statistician as data analyst has become both
  more central, and more demanding. As more data analysis and more
  decisions based on it are being shifted from humans to computers,
  statistics is called upon to design and validate the procedures used
  to take these decisions. Thus, the statician's importance in a much
  wider range of human activities, be they science or buisness. But
  the statistician's responsability is comensurately growins, as she
  needs to master the skills required by cyber-enabled science and
  data analysis. 
\item These skills include are not limited to computer using and
  programming skills. The nature of statistical analyses itself is
  affected \mmp{get some citations} as it has been long
  recognized. Computationally aware statistical methods need to be
  designed. Very large samples will support models of a complexity
  that could not be considered in real-life scenarios a decade or two
  ago. It is now not possible to perform model selection by explicitly
  comparing all possible models (i.e. there can be an exponential
  number of models to compare) and regularization methods are often
  called into play, as are approximate computational
  techniques. Leveraging unlabeled data for prediction is now an
  almost universal necessity. Devising new methods to evaluate complex
  models in an environment that is not stationary, nor controlled are
  some of the challenges of modern data analysis.
\item The proposal fits in and leverages other efforts and successes at UW in creating a strong collaborative environment for \cdse~ (the e-science Institute, the IGERT for graduate education in Big Data and related PhD tracks already existing in CSE and Statistics). The time is ripe to involve undergraduates, and specifically statistics and mathematics majors in this change.
\item This proposal is in the spirit of the ACMS original mission,
  bringing this part up to speed with the demands of the coming decade.
\eit

{\bf Why this particular approach} Currently, computer education is
assured primarily through two core courses, CSE 142, 143
\cite{cse142}. These set the foundations in the understanding of
computer programming, but they are of a general nature, and are mainly
focuses towards preparing future programmers. (These courses are the
same courses that the about 500 CSE majors take). Thus, there is no
room for data analysis applications in these courses. The need for a
dedicated scientific computing course was recognized, hence the
Scientific Computing track and courses developed by AMATH. There is an
R course (STAT 302, 2 credits) offered as an elective. However, for
reasons we will develop later, we consider that Python is the more
appropriate computer language for our goals. Thus, we will both
introduce Python and will use it to teach statitical methodology. As
Python will be taught as a second programming language, and as it is
similar enough to Java, we expect the students to be assimilate it
quickly under our guidance. 

\mmp{ to continue after the proposal more fleshed out}

{\bf What we want to do}

\bit
\item To transform the ACMS Statistics track into a computer intensive statistics major. 
  \bit
   \item Stage 1: Design and introduce two new courses STAT 391, ASTRO 598 as {\em electives} in the track.
   \item Stage 2: Redesign the track: move STAT 391, Stochastic Processes STAT 481, 482 into the core. As this will no longer be regarded as a second major for science students, we will make room by removing the PHYS 121, 122, 123 courses (15 credits) from it. Reorganizing the electives into two groups: group I (math/stat electives) and group II computing and science electives. 
   \item Stage 3: ?? Making these courses accessible to mathematics majors, via William Steins python programming course. 
  \eit
\item To develop a software infrastructure for teaching \cdse~ in
  Python. This will include data sets, data analysis problems,
  software libraries, and course modules built around the data and
  problems. This infrastructure will be made available via the
  web. Due to its modular structure, it will be useable as needed by
  instructors in other courses.
\item To organize an Undergraduate Research Seminar. In this seminar, unlike the ACMS 
\item To organize a 3 day workshop for instructors in statistics and related fields that will teach the basics of using our sofware infrastructure and will impart our experience in the project.

The Program Core is a set of courses totaling 43 credits which are generally required for all ACMS majors. Exceptions are specifically pointed out in the descriptions of the various options. The core courses will provide a solid foundation from which students may pursue any of the approved degree pathways within the Program. }

\mmp{put this somewhere?}
{\em A fundamental concept at the core of the ACMS program is modeling - casting a real world problem in a way that makes it amenable to mathematical, statistical, or computational analysis. 
 Continuous modeling, while central to many applications, is not part of the CSE undergraduate curriculum, and statistical modeling is only a small component. }

\section{Description of the courses}
\label{sec:course-descr}

\bit
\item STAT 391 ``Probability and Statistics for Computer Science''
``Computational Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning''
\item ASTRO 497 ``Data Intensive Astronomy'' 
\eit 
These courses aims are explicitly to (1) to give students a hands on experience, through programming, and performing real data analyses on a computer, with the computational aspects of 
statistical modeling in general, and (2) to introduce them to the  machine learning methodology in particular, with specific attention to the issues of big data.

The material covered will be partly overlapping with other courses
(e.g. regression, probability models for discrete data) and partly new
(e.g. classification, clustering). However, the treatment of the
material will stress on the interaction of computational and
statistical aspects in modeling and prediction with scientific and
engineering data. In this sense, the overlap has not been avoided; so that
the student can gain a new, computational perspective, on areas
already studied from a more theoretical point of view.

\subsection{Format and student experience}

The courses will consist of lectures, homework assignments, 1--2
miniprojects, and a final exam. The TA will hold recitations; about
half of these will be in a (virtual) computer lab environment. 

{\bf The Computer Lab recitations} will offer support for learning Python, as well as specific data analysis tools \mmp{examples: libraries, tools, from the book}   The student will practice working in groups, the technique of extreme programming, using a debugger.

Another experience in the computer lab will be actual data analysis and visualization using the tools. 

\mmp{the postdoc will train/supervise the TA's for both courses}

{\bf Homework assignments} There will be 4-5 weekly homework assignments. They will contain concept problems, algorithms problems, programming assignments, and data analysis assignments.

A note on the overlap between STAT 391 and ASTRO 497: Where the two
courses have overlapping topics, ASTRO will consider the big data case
explicitly, while STAT 391 will be considering the connections between
statistical theory and computation. STAT 391 will support more basic
Python, while ASTRO 597 will support Python libraries for big data.

{\bf Lectures} We will blend in computer demos, class question and answer, and group discussion with the standard lecture format.

\subsection{Precursors (and about the PI's-- here or later?)}
\label{sec:precursors}

A previous version of {\bf STAT 391} was developed and taught by \meila for 11 years as ``Probability and Statistics for Computer Science''.

Recently, (i.e. 2010) CSE introduced their own introduction to probability and statistics, CSE 312.  While STAT 391 continues to be taught and recommended as an elective, it was clear that the course could not remain in its original form.
Therefore, in Spring 2013, the PI \meila with Hoyt Koepke, revised the course, having in mind that
\bit
\item the audience was now literate in statistics and probability
\item the course could now be opened to a larger audience 
\eit
I opted to replace the introductory material with more advanced topics, and for these I chose a set of basic machine learning topics. I also introduced more substantial data analysis assignments. These changes were implemented by Hoyt Kopke, who taught the class. The course web page is at {\tt }. The student feedback to this pilot experiment was very encouraging. \mmp{specifics: how many students, what depts, they liked being made to learn python, loved the projects too, level was demanding}

\meila with Connoly co-taught an extremely well received course at CMU in 1999-200. \mmp{fill in 1-2 more sentences}

\mmp{some of this needs revision}
\bit
\item These courses fit very well with the original goal and mission of the  ACMS program. The revision we propose will take it to a level corresponding to the current state
\item Crosscultural diversity: ACMS students will share the class with CS majors (STAT 391) or Astronomy and Physics majors
\item General increased interest from employers in computational statistics, big data, machine learning, together or separately. We expect that ACMS students, too, will be well served by these courses.

\subsection{ASTR 598} 

Copied text from that email, which was copied from our book, to see
how many pages it would take...

\subsubsection{Motivation for Astr 598}

Astronomy and astrophysics are witnessing dramatic increases in data volume 
as detectors, telescopes, and computers become ever more powerful. During the 
last decade, sky surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum have collected 
hundreds of terabytes of astronomical data for hundreds of millions of sources. 
Over the next decade, the data volume will enter the petabyte domain, and provide 
accurate measurements for billions of sources. Astronomy and physics students 
are not traditionally trained to handle such voluminous and complex data sets. 
Furthermore, standard analysis methods employed in astronomy often lag far 
behind rapid progress in statistics and computer science. The main
goal of this course is to contribute to efficient training of next
generations of students to 
handle the fast growing data sets, not only in astronomy, but in other quantitative 
sciences as well. 

This course will be aimed at physical and data-centric math,
statistics, science and engineering students
who have an understanding of the science drivers for analyzing large data sets but 
may not be aware of appropriate statistical techniques for doing so. The course work 
will provide to students a connection between scientific data analysis problems and 
modern statistical methods. We will limit theoretical discussions to the minimum 
required to understand the algorithms and will build the courses upon an 
example-driven compendium of modern statistical and data mining methods, 
together with carefully chosen examples based on real modern data sets, and of 
current astronomical applications that will illustrate each method introduced in the 
book. Discussion of the advanced material will be supported by appropriate (publicly 
available) Python code and data which will enable students to perform exercises, 
evaluate the techniques, and adapt them to their own fields of interest. We chose to 
use Python, a powerful and flexible programming language that is quickly becoming 
a standard in data-intensive sciences (and elsewhere). 

The target audience for our course includes undergraduate students with scientific 
or engineering background, but it is likely that graduate students
would benefit from it too. Familiarity with calculus and other basic mathematical 
techniques will be assumed, but no extensive prior knowledge in statistics will be 
required.

Observational Astronomy, in press) coauthored by the Co-PIs on this prooposal. 



\subsection{Python Packages} 


\begin{figure*}[!t]
\vskip -1.8in
\includegraphics[width=1.02\hsize,clip]{astroML.eps}
\vskip -2.0in
\caption{We will leverage all the modern python tools available in {\it astroML} and
other packages, including a large number of practical data-intensive exercises developed to
support textbook that will be used with the proposed ASTR 598 course.} 
\label{Fig:astroML}
\end{figure*}


We will leverage all the publicly available modern python tools. In particular, seminar work will be 
built around the {\it astroML} package (available from http://www.astroml.org) that was developed 
to support textbook to be used with the proposed ASTR 598 course. {\it astroML} is a python module 
for machine learning and data mining built on {\it numpy}, {\it scipy}, {\it scikit-learn}, and {\it matplotlib}, 
and distributed under the 3-clause BSD license. It contains a growing library of statistical and machine 
learning routines for analyzing astronomical data in python, loaders for several open astronomical datasets, 
and a large suite of examples of analyzing and visualizing astronomical datasets (there are close to two 
hundred examples of machine learning and visualization in the code library that supports the textbook 
alone). In addition to  {\it astroML} package, we will expose students to several other popular and widely
used toolkits (e.g. PyMC for Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and HealPy for spherical coordinates 
and spherical harmonic transformations). 

As an example of methods and exercises available in  {\it astroML}, we single out methods 
for reducing data dimensionality. Many astronomical analyses must address the question of the 
complexity as well as size of the data set. Dimensionality reduction methods address the
complexity issue  by finding the directions within a multivariate data set that contain most 
of the information. Classical approaches for identifying the principal dimensions include
principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and non-negative 
matrix factorization (NMF). These methods are implemented in   {\it astroML}, with a user-friendly 
interface and adequate documentation (see Figure~\ref{Fig:astroML}). Furthermore, {\it astroML} also 
includes easy-to-use code to automatically access and download spectra collected by the Sloan Digital 
Sky Survey (currently a ``gold standard'' for modern astronomical surveys and big data sets; see sdss.org). 
Therefore, an undergraduate student will not only be exposed to modern statistical methods
and a cutting-edge astronomical data set, but will be empowered to actually apply these methods 
to a real complex and massive data set.  The result of this exercise is shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:astroML2}. 
With such a positive experience, it is very likely that such a student would not have difficulties applying 
the same methods and tools later to potentially unrelated problems.

spectra using PCA (left panel), ICA (middle panel) and NMF (right panel). The rank of the component
increases from top to bottom. For the ICA and PCA the first component is the mean spectrum (NMF 
does not require mean subtraction). All of these techniques isolate a common set of spectral features 
(identifying features associated with the continuum and line emission). The ordering of the spectral 
components is technique dependent.}
