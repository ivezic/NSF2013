\section{EDUCATION AND TRAINING}
\label{sec:education}
\subsection{\bf About the ACMS program}

The ACMS {\em (Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences)} was
introduced in 1998 as a joint undergraduate program between the
departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering
(CSE), Mathematics, and Statistics, among others.
The program is structured into a {\em core} set of courses,
totaling 43 credits, and a set of options, or {\em tracks}. The tracks
are either associated with a particular application domain ({\em
  Biological and Life Sciences, Mathematical Economics, Social and
  Behavioral Sciences, Engineering and Physical Sciences}) or with a
particular area in the mathematical sciences ({\em Discrete Math and
  Algorithms, Operations Research, Scientific Computing and Numerical
  Analysis, and \underline{Statistics}}).

It is the Statistics track of ACMS that we are aiming to
tranform. Currently, this track contains, in addition to the core
courses, the following:
\\
{\bf Option Core (37 credits)}
\bits
    \item {\sc PHYS 121-2-3} (replaceable by other courses in application areas)
    \item {\sc STAT 302} Statistical Software and Its Applications (R course, irregularly offered, 2 credits)
    \item {\sc STAT 340} Probability and Mathematical Statistics
    \item {\sc STAT 341-2} to Probability and Statistical Inference I,II
    \item {\sc STAT 421} Applied Statistics and Experiment Design
    \item {\sc STAT 423} Applied Regression and Analysis of Variance
\eits
{\bf Option Electives (10 credits)}
\bits
    \item {\sc MATH/STAT 396} Probability III
    \item {\sc MATH/STAT 491-2} Stochastic Processes
    \item {\sc STAT 403}  Resampling Inference
    \item {\sc STAT 427}  Analysis of Categorical Data
    \item {\sc STAT/BIOST 529} Sample Survey Techniques
    \item {\sc CSE 373} Data Structures
    \item {\sc MATH 300} Mathematical Reasoning
    \item {\sc MATH 327}  Real Analysis I
    \item {\sc MATH 407--8--9} Linear, Nonlinear,\& Discrete Optimization
    \item {\sc STAT 428} Multivariate Analysis for the Social Sciences
    \item {\sc GEOG 426} Quantitative Methods in Geography
    \item {\sc QMETH 528} Survey Sampling Applications
    \item {\sc STAT 498} Special topics
\eits
The program web page recommends that ``[this track] is ideally suited as a {\em second major} for students with a primary focus in the [\ldots] sciences''.
The track curriculum differs little from the ``standard'' Statistics major,
most notably by the presence of the computer programming class {\sc CSE 142}.

{\bf Enrollment} The ACMS major is competitive, with the number of
majors capped at about 200.  During the recent academic years,
graduation numbers have passed 100 students per year; the current
enrollment is at 147\footnote{A complete breakdown of ACMS graduation
  numbers from 1998 on are available in the Supplementary material.}.
Of these, the Statistics track accounts for {\it only} 4 students
currently enrolled (none as double majors), and for 2 to 6 students
graduated in each of the last 5 years. In the same time, enrollment in
the Statistics major is at an all times high, with 127 currently
enrolled students (74 double majors, 53 single majors) of which 77 are
women.

\subsection{Transforming the Statistics  ACMS track}
We propose to use the ACMS Statistics track as a vehicle to create a
data-intensive or Big Data track in statistics. This transformative
program will focus on teaching computational and statistical thinking.
It will incorporate research within the teaching
components and apply best practices when developing a diverse and
representative student cohort.  In other words, the program will aim not to
produce scientists who also know statistics (which can be well served
by Statistics minor and other tracks of ACMS) but full-fledged
data scientists who can function autonomously in the modern workforce.

There are several motivating factors:
\bit
\item The role of
 the statistician as data analyst and scientist has become more central
 within both research and industry, and thus more demanding.
 As more data analysis and statistical reasoning tasks
 are being automated using computers, statistical analysis is
 increasingly employed in the design and validation of the procedures used.
 The statistician's responsibility is commensurately growing, as (s)he needs
 to master the wider skills required by cyber-enabled science and data
 analysis.
\item Interest in statistics is at an all-time high, as witnessed by
  our enrollment numbers. We expect that the ACMS Statistics track
  will reach similar enrollment numbers. Note that at the current
  enrollment in the other tracks, the total ACMS enrollment will be
  near 200.
%\item There is a disconnect between the classical statistics
%  curriculum and the computational needs of the next generation of Big
%  Data statisticians in both academia and industry.
\item The nature of statistical analyses is itself affected by the
  rapid increase in data volumes \cite{friedman:97}; as has 
  long been recognized. Computationally intensive statistical methods need to
  be designed. Very large samples will support models of a complexity
  that could not be considered in real-life scenarios a decade or two
  ago. 
  With an exponential number of potential models, brute-force comparison
  is no longer possible.
  %It is no longer possible to perform model selection by explicitly
  %comparing all possible models (i.e.\ there can be an exponential
  %number of models to compare).
  Addressing the challenges of modern data analysis requires novel approaches
  involving regularization schemes, approximation techniques, and prediction
  robust to unlabeled or non-stationary data.
  %and regularization methods are often
  %called into play, as are approximate computational
  %techniques. Leveraging unlabeled data for prediction is now an
  %almost universal necessity. Devising new methods to evaluate complex
  %models in an environment that is not stationary, nor controlled are
  %some of the challenges of modern data analysis.
\item The proposal leverages other \cdse\ efforts and successes at UW for creating a strong collaborative environment (the eScience Institute, the IGERT for graduate education in Big Data, and the related PhD tracks recently created in CSE and Statistics). The time is ripe to involve undergraduates, and specifically statistics and mathematics majors in this change.
%\item This proposal is in the spirit of the ACMS original mission,
%  bringing this program up to speed with the demands of the coming decade.

\subsection{Work Plan}

\noindent We divide the proposed project into three stages; roughly map to a yearly schedule.

\noindent {\bf Stage 1:} Design and introduce two new courses,
\statcl, \astrocl,
as {\em electives} in the track.  Start the Undergraduate \cdse~
Research Seminar. This seminar will differ from the existing ``ACMS''
Undergraduate Math Science Seminar ({\sc Math 498}), in that the
speakers will be undergraduates themselves or their mentors, and the
seminar topics will be their research projects (see Section
\ref{sec:research} for more details).

\noindent {\bf Stage 2:} Redesign the track to address the needs of Big Data
based on the evaluation of the first year of activities: move \statcl,
``Stochastic Processes'' {\sc STAT 481, 482} into the core. As the track
will no longer be regarded as a second major for science students, we
will make room by removing the {\sc PHYS 121-2-3} courses (15 credits)
from it.  We will target interests of the diverse student body
by reorganizing the electives into two complementary groups:
math/stat electives (group I) and computing and science electives
(group II).  Further reorganization of the core and electives could include
adding one or both of {\sc AMATH 482, 483} ``Data analysis'', and
``High performance scientific computing''.
%consultation with Statistics faculty and the other ACMS participating
%departments and Schools. 
Organization of a workshop for UW faculty to share our experiences and
teaching infrastructure

\noindent {\bf Stage 3:} 
%Incorporate feedback from evaluators and all participants. Continue
%developing the courses' %software and data infrastructure. 
Broaden the the science components of this program beyond Astronomy.
Evaluate the integration of the courses into the Mathematics majors
curriculum. Mathematics Professor William Stein, creator and leader of
the {\tt Sage} project\footnote{{\tt www.sagemath.org/}}, teaches a
successful Python programming course in Mathematics, which could serve
as a pathway towards one or both of the two new courses.


{\bf Why this particular approach?} Currently, computer education is
assured primarily through two core courses, {\sc Cse 142, 143}
\cite{Reges:java}. These set the foundations in the understanding of
computer programming, but they are of a general nature, and are mainly
focused towards preparing future programmers  (these courses are the
same courses that the approximately 500 CSE majors take). Thus, there
is no room for data analysis applications in these courses.  There is
also a programming in R course ({\sc Stat 302}, 2 credits) but it is 
offered quite irregularly.

For reasons we will expound in Section \ref{sec:Python}, we
consider that Python is the more appropriate computer language for our
goals. Thus, this curriculum will both introduce Python and will utilize it to
teach statistical methodology.  As Python will be taught as a second
programming language, and as it is similar enough to Java (taught in
{\sc Cse 142}), we expect the students to assimilate it quickly under our
guidance (there are also numerous publicly available tutorials).
In Spring 2013, a pilot course was taught (by H. Koepke,
Statistics) that introduced Python and taught statistical modeling
using the language, to an audience of around 40 CSE undergraduates
(the vast majority of whom did {\em not} know Python). The students'
feedback was very encouraging, and one of the reasons we are confident
in our approach.

%The need for a dedicated scientific computing course was long
%recognized, hence the Scientific Computing track and courses developed
%by {Amath \sc 481} (project based, in Matlab) {\sc 482}, and {\sc 483}. 
%Our proposed courses are not replicating, but adding a new dimension to
%the existing AMATH courses. The latter focus on the ``signal
%processing'' aspects of data analysis (e.g filtering, {\sc Amath
 % 482}) and on the ``hardware, software, and programming for
%large-scale scientific computing'' ({\sc Amath 483}), while our
%courses focus on the statistical modeling and statistical decision
%making aspects.

Third, we chose to separate the education/teaching component and the
research component into courses and a research seminar, respectively. We
consider this the better option, since the courses will have to teach
both programming and methodology. Pursuing too many goals in the
course of a single class would have been detrimental to solid learning.

\subsection{Description of the courses}
\label{sec:course-descr}

\bits
\item \statcl~``Computational Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning'' (4 credits)
\item \astrocl~``Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy'' (3 credits)
\eits

The aims of these sources are to (1) provide a strong statistical
foundation in data analysis (2) give students hands-on experience,
through programming, and performing real data analyses with the
computational aspects of statistical modeling, and (3) introduce them
to the machine learning methodology in particular, with specific
attention to the issues of big data.

The material covered will be partly overlapping with other courses
(e.g. regression, probability models for discrete data) and partly new
(e.g. classification, clustering). However, the treatment of the
material will stress the interaction of computational and
statistical aspects in modeling and prediction with scientific and
engineering data. In this sense, the overlap is deliberate
so that the students can gain a new computational perspective on areas
already studied from a more theoretical point of view. 

{\bf Prerequisites} (for either course): an introductory programming
course (not necessarily in Python), e.g. CSE 142 or equivalent
programming experience; an introductory statistics course; mathematics
multivariate calculus. 
%The two courses can be taken in a sequence
%\statcl--\astrocl, or separately. These course can be accessible to
%other juniors and seniors with a strong quantitative background.


%{\bf Format and student experience} 
%The courses will consist of lectures, homework assignments, 1--2
%miniprojects, and a final exam. The TA will hold quiz sections; about
%half of these will be in a (virtual) computer lab environment. 

{\bf The Computer Lab recitations} will offer support for learning
Python, as well as specific data analysis tools (see Section \ref{sec:Python}).
The students will practice programming in pairs (a.k.a extreme
programming), using debuggers, profilers, writing modifiable code, etc.
Another experience in the computer lab will be actual data analysis
and visualization using the tools, development of skills related to data
visualisation, experimental data recording and reporting, etc.

{\bf Homework assignments} There will be 4-5 homework
assignments. They will contain concept problems, algorithmic problems,
programming assignments, and data analysis assignments.

A note on the overlap between \statcl~ and \astrocl: Where the two
courses have overlapping topics, \astrocl~ will consider the big data case
explicitly, while \statcl~ will consider the connections between
statistical theory and computation. \statcl~ will cover more basic
Python, while \astrocl~ will cover Python libraries for working with big data.

\item  \underline{\statcl~ ``Computational Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning''{\bf Draft Syllabus}} \\
\bit
\item a review of the concept of likelihood and Max Likelihood estimation (cases in which MLE has no closed form, gradient ascent/Newton estimation of MLE)
\item a review of basic probability models with focus on ML estimation of these models, supported heavily by simulation (e.g demonstrating gaussianity of MLE for certain models, and non-gaussianity for other models, including Zipf's law type distributions)
\item models for statistical prediction, with focus on classification
\item review and computational aspects of other statistical topics like
  density estimation, clustering, model selection and validation
  (including regularization and  nonparametric modeling)
\item intro to programming in Python, and to Python libraries supporting scientific computing
\item examples of real applications from engineering and sciences (image analysis, information retrieval, etc.)
\eit
\item[]{\bf Learning goals for \statcl:} Ability to perform computationally intensive, automated, robust and efficient data analysis. Ability to combine existing tools and libraries with programming in a general purpose language (Python). 
Working knowledge of the most important/main machine learning tools and methods, as well as their probabilistic interpretation. Understanding of the practical implications of theoretical results like independence, overfitting, consistency of an estimator. 

{\bf Textbooks:} Unfortunately, there is currently no single textbook
suitable for this course. We will rely partly on \meila's previously
developed course notes for {\it ``Probability and Statistics for
  Computer Science''}, a computationally minded introductory course,
partly on new course notes to be developed by \meila\ specifically for
this more advanced course, and partly on the textbook of \astrocl,
which will provide among others the Python exercises. %We are also
%considering material from the new machine learning book written for
%undergraduate students \cite{Witten:13}.

\comment{
\item{Motivation for \astrocl} \mmp{shorter,more to the point of grant}
Astronomy and astrophysics are witnessing dramatic increases in data volume 
as detectors, telescopes, and computers become ever more powerful. During the 
last decade, sky surveys across the electromagnetic spectrum have collected 
hundreds of terabytes of astronomical data for hundreds of millions of sources. 
Over the next decade, the data volume will enter the petabyte domain, and provide 
accurate measurements for billions of sources. Astronomy and physics students 
are not traditionally trained to handle such voluminous and complex data sets. 
Furthermore, standard analysis methods employed in astronomy often lag far 
behind rapid progress in statistics and computer science. The main
goal of this course is to contribute to efficient training of next
generations of students to 
handle the fast growing data sets, not only in astronomy, but in other quantitative 
sciences as well. 

This course will be aimed at physical and data-centric math,
statistics, science and engineering students
who have an understanding of the science drivers for analyzing large data sets but 
may not be aware of appropriate statistical techniques for doing so. The course work 
will provide to students a connection between scientific data analysis problems and 
modern statistical methods. We will limit theoretical discussions to the minimum 
required to understand the algorithms and will build the courses upon an 
example-driven compendium of modern statistical and data mining methods, 
together with carefully chosen examples based on real modern data sets, and of 
current astronomical applications that will illustrate each method introduced in the 
book. Discussion of the advanced material will be supported by appropriate (publicly 
available) Python code and data which will enable students to perform exercises, 
evaluate the techniques, and adapt them to their own fields of interest. We chose to 
use Python, a powerful and flexible programming language that is quickly becoming 
a standard in data-intensive sciences (and elsewhere). 

The target audience for our course includes undergraduate students
with scientific or engineering background, but it is likely that
graduate students would benefit from it too. Familiarity with calculus
and other basic mathematical techniques will be assumed, but no
extensive prior knowledge in statistics will be required.

\subsection{Python Packages} 
\label{sec:Python}


We will leverage all the publicly available modern Python tools. In
particular, many of the practical examples
will be built around the {\it astroML}
package\footnote{\url{http://www.astroml.org}} that was developed by
Co-PIs to support the textbook used in the proposed \astrocl\
course. {\it astroML} is an open-source Python module for machine learning
and data mining built on {\it numpy}, {\it scipy}, {\it scikit-learn},
and {\it matplotlib}. It
contains a growing library of statistical and machine learning
routines for analyzing astronomical data in Python, loaders for
several open astronomical datasets, and a large suite of examples of
data analysis and visualization in the astronomical context
(there are close to
two hundred examples of machine learning and visualization in the code
library that supports the textbook alone). In addition to the {\it
  astroML} package, we will expose students to several other popular
and widely used toolkits (e.g. PyMC for Markov Chain Monte Carlo
methods, and HealPy for spherical coordinates and spherical harmonic
transformations).

As an example of the methods and exercises available in {\it astroML},
we single out methods for reducing data dimensionality. Many
astronomical analyses must address the question of the complexity as
well as size of the data set. Dimensionality reduction addresses the
complexity issue by finding the directions within a multivariate data
set that contain most of the information. Classical approaches for
identifying the principal dimensions include principal component
analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF). These methods are implemented in {\it
  astroML}, with a well-documented user-friendly interface (see
Figure~\ref{Fig:astroML}). Furthermore, {\it astroML} includes
easy-to-use code to automatically access and download spectra
collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (currently the ``gold
standard'' for modern astronomical surveys and big data sets; see
sdss.org).  Through this, an undergraduate student will not only be
exposed to modern statistical methods and cutting-edge astronomical
data sets, but will be empowered to actually apply these methods to
real and complex data set.  The result of this exercise is shown in
Figure~\ref{Fig:astroML2}.  With such a positive experience, it is
likely that students would be able to incorporate the methods and
tools taught in this class into other data-intensive sciences.

spectra using PCA (left panel), ICA (middle panel) and NMF (right panel). The rank of the component
increases from top to bottom. For the ICA and PCA the first component is the mean spectrum (NMF 
does not require mean subtraction). All of these techniques isolate a common set of spectral features 
(identifying features associated with the continuum and line emission). The ordering of the spectral 
components is technique dependent. The SDSS spectroscopic database contains over a million
such spectra.}

\subsection{What we are building on?}
\label{sec:precursors}

All Co-I's have extensive experience in teaching data intensive
statistics and in incorporating these methodologies into undergraduate
research. \meila~ has extensive previous experience teaching
computational statistics courses at all levels. She developed the
course ``Probability and Statistics for Computer Science'', an
introductory course aimed at computer science majors, complete with
exercises and demos in Matlab, revised the Statistical Computing
graduate course sequence, later developed the Statistical Learning
graduate sequence and led, with Prof. Emily Fox, the effort to
introduce the Machine Learning/Big Data PhD track in the Statistics
department.

Connolly teaches a graduate class ASTR 597 ``Statistics and Machine
Learning'' at the Department of Astronomy. Ivezi\'{c} teaches a
graduate class ASTR 507 ``Astrophysics I'', which includes
introduction to statistical data analysis and Bayesian statistics.
VanderPlas teaches a graduate seminar course Astr 599 ``Scientific
Computing with Python''.  Materials and experienced developed in these
courses will be leveraged in the development of this program (see
Sections \ref{sec:Python} and \ref{sec:Jake}).  \meila\ and Connolly
co-taught an extremely well received course at CMU in 1999-2000,
``Computational Statistics of Multi-Dimensional Scientific
Databases'', which united students from Statistics, Computer Science
and Astronomy, as well as faculty from these departments.

%The Statistics department runs a {\em Virtual computer lab} that will
%be used by \statcl~ students in their quiz sessions and assignments.
%The clusters {\tt newton1,2}, consisting of 8, respectively 2 high memory nodes, 
%The high-memory computer clusters,

%basis for the graduate student research. The Pre-MAP program (see Section \ref{sec:MNRetaining})
%run by the Department of Astronomy will be used for recruitment. 
% \mmp{shall i buy more nodes??}

The {\it astroML} textbook and the supporting public web site will provide the starting 
point for the new courses' software and data infrastructure (see
Section \ref{sec:Python}). All compute resources will be provide
either by the Statistics department or, for cloud computing, through
the eScience Institute as part of their Data Science Initiative.

\comment{
(Recently, starting 2011, CSE created their own introduction to
probability and statistics, {\sc CSE 312}. Thus it is clear that
\statcl~ can not serve its original purpose and audience.)
\mmp{keep this?}
Therefore, in Spring 2013, the PI \meila with Hoyt Koepke, revised the
course, having in mind that \bit
\item the audience was now literate in statistics and probability
\item the course could now be opened to a larger audience 
\eit
I opted to replace the introductory material with more advanced topics, and for these I chose a set of basic machine learning topics. I also introduced more substantial data analysis assignments. These changes were implemented by Hoyt Kopke, who taught the class. The course web page is at {\tt }. The student feedback to this pilot experiment was very encouraging. \mmp{specifics: how many students, what depts, they liked being made to learn Python, loved the projects too, level was demanding}
